# Distributed Systems Challenges
This repository contains my attempt to follow along with the distributed systems challenges presented by Jon Gjengset in his YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI) "Solving distributed systems challenges in Rust"

## Challenges
The challenges in this repository are designed to explore different aspects of distributed systems and provide hands-on experience with building scalable and resilient applications. Each challenge focuses on a specific problem or concept and provides an opportunity to learn and apply distributed systems principles.

The challenges included in this repository are:

- [x] Challenge 1: Echo
